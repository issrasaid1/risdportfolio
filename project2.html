    <h3 style=" text-align:center"> CSCI 1300: User Interfaces & User Experiences 2020 </h3>
    <h5 style=" font-style: italic; text-align:center"> This project is a close analysis done on microwaves, specifically in regards to its design, interface and challenges to its usability.
      I utilized user expereience research techniques such as behavioral observation, user interviewing, and persona creation,
      storyboarding. Although the microwave is assumed as a simple interface, I was surprised to learn about a common challenge
      in regards to setting the cook time and also an unwillingness to use other cook settings on the microwave.</h5>

<h2 style="text-align:center"> Microwave sketch </h2>

  <img src=" IMG_0103.PNG" style="width:50%" class="center">
<p >This interface heats up food products. The user can adjust the setting depending on what
  they are microwaving and they can also choose the amount of time to heat up
   their food by interacting with the buttons on the right hand panel.
   To open the microwave door, the user pushes the button at the very bottom.</p>


<h2 style="text-align:center">User observations</h2>
<p style=" font-style: italic"> I interviewed three people to observe the way they interact with the interface. I asked them to use the microwave and took notes on how they did this.</p>
<p > Interviewee 1: </p>
<ul>
<li  >Opened and closed microwave door easily</li>
<li  >Placed food in the center of microwave dish</li>
<li >She struggled to start, forgot to press clear before clicking on the number buttons to set the time</li>
</ul>

<p  > Interviewee 2:</p>
<ul >
<li >Opened and closed microwave door easily</li>
<li >Placed food in the center of microwave dish</li>
<li >Used the timer on accident instead of cook time - could not figure it out how to set an exact time including seconds (e.g. 1 minute and 35 seconds)</li>
</ul>

<p>Interviewee 3:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opened and closed microwave door easily</li>
<li>Placed food in the center of microwave dish</li>
<li>Set time and started the microwave easily by selecting Cook Time and entering the amount of seconds manually with the number buttons</li>
</ul>



<h2 style="text-align:center">Interview questions</h2>
<p style=" font-style: italic"> I proceeded to ask these interviewees a few questions to learn more about how they usually interact with this interface.</p>
<ol>
<li >Why do you use the microwave? </li>
<li >What do you microwave?</li>
<li>What microwave settings do you use (e.g. fish, preheat, etc.)?</li>
<li>How often do you use the microwave?</li>
<li>What alternatives to the microwave do you use, if any? When do you use those vs the microwave and why? </li>
<li >What does the microwave do well? What do you like about the microwave as opposed to other heating systems? </li>
<li >What challenges are there when using the interface of the microwave?  </li>
</ol>



<h2 style="text-align:center">Summary of interview responses</h2>
<p > Interviewee 1: </p>
<ul >
<li>Microwave is easy to use, does not require skill (less labor than cooking)</li>
<li>Settings are confusing to them - does not understand what they do exactly</li>
<li>Use for frozen foods, leftovers, to heat up room temperature/cold food</li>
<li>Use everyday because they are too busy to cook in college (uses the microwave less often at home)
</li>
<li>Also uses stoves or ovens when they are cooking food with ingredients (i.e. anything other than frozen food and leftovers)</li>
<li>Likes to multitask while microwaving (no need to watch the microwave unlike the stove)</li>
<li>Challenges to interface: Cannot press any buttons to start until you clear the time - gets confused when the buttons are not working
</li>
</ul>

<p> Interviewee 2: </p>
<ul >
  <li>Microwaves most of their food (eats a lot of leftovers and frozen food)</li>
  <li>Does not trust the settings on the microwaves because the microwave does not know how she likes her food</li>
  <li>Does not use any alternatives to the microwave because they do not know how to use the oven or cook in general</li>
  <li>Microwave is simple to use - put the food in and when it beeps you take it out</li>
  <li>Challenges to interface: every microwave is different, there is a learning curve when using a new one </li>
  <ul>
      <li>E.g. How to set the time (being able to write out the time in seconds by just using the number buttons vs having to press cook time first)</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<p > Interviewee 3: </p>
<ul >
  <li>Uses microwave for heating up food (e.g. leftovers, food that has gone cold, frozen foods,  but not for not for cooking)</li>
  <ul>
        <li>Reasoning: some foods are not good to put in the microwave, e.g. a sandwich can get too soft or soggy from the microwave </li>
      </ul>
  <li>Only uses these settings: Add 30 seconds, Start, Cook time</li>
  <li>Uses the microwave everyday</li>
  <li>Alternatives to microwave: uses stove for bigger meals</li>
  <li>Microwave is faster than other heating tools</li>
  <ul>
      <li>Important because she is busy, wants to eat when she wants instead of having to wait for her food on the stove or in the oven</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Challenges to interface: sometimes presses timer instead of cook time and then is confused as to why the food is not being microwaved</li>
</ul>



<h2 style="text-align:center">Personas</h2>
<p > I constructed 2 personas by creating a four-quadrant empathy map,
  describing what users think, feel, say, and do for one archetypal character that represent part of the spectrum of users I observed. I drew from my interviews to construct these personas. </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">Storyboarding</h2>
<p > I, next, chose one of the personas (Busy Brandon) to map their interaction with the microwave. This storyboard illustrates Busy Brandon's user journey from start to end.  </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">Conclusion</h2>
<p > In conclusion, I learned how to critically examine simple everyday user interfaces like the microwave.
  In addition, creating personas made me more aware of the many different ways users can interact with the same interface. </p>
